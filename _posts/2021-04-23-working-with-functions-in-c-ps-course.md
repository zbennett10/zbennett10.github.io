I am happy to announce that I've just released another course on Pluralsight! I'm really proud of this one. In this course, "Working with Functions in C", I break down every function within the C standard library. This was a huge learning adventure for myself and I hope that it simplifies C - specifically functions - to all who watch/listen to it!

This course was a pleasure to create. I loved exploring the lesser-known portions of the C standard library such as the `setjmp.h` header file which facilitates non-local jumping in C (think `goto`).

This course was also the final course needed in order to complete the "C Development Fundamentals" learning path on Pluralsight. I am proud to have created courses alongside some other really great authors like [Jaya Bodkhey](https://twitter.com/jayabodkhey).


In this course, you learn about:

- User-defined functions in C
- Creating private/public C APIs, static functions, etc.
- Every function within the C standard library - including practical examples of each one

For my next course, I'll be breaking away from C a bit and will instead be focusing on Kubernetes and Go. I'm super pumped about this as Kubernetes/Go are both really hot topics. The course will be covering how you and/or your organization can customize and extend the Kubernetes API! It's going to be fantastic...
