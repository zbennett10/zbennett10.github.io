It's official! I've had my first ever video course published on Pluralsight. The course title is "Managing Data and Memory Allocation In C". 

Having this course published is certainly a surreal experience. I used to watch Pluralsight courses and I never thought I would create my own. However towards the start of 2020, I made it my goal to create a video course audition and start creating courses. My goal is to get to at least 50 published courses! Well - 1 down, 49 more to go...

As a software engineer, this course involved quite a bit of learning on my part. As part of this course, you create a fixed-size memory pool manager in C. This is done to demonstrate the benefits of using custom memory managers that wrap malloc and other stdlib memory functions. I learned a lot while implementing this memory manager and I believe that I'm a better, more well-rounded engineer because of it. Awesome things happen when you teach a subject - it truly cements your knowledge of certain concepts.

In this course, you learn quite a bit about:

- Core C, memory functions like malloc, calloc, realloc and free
- Managing memory using pointers
- Managing memory using arrays and structs
- Custom memory managers

I already have plans underway for my next Pluralsight course as well. This next course will also relate to the C programming language!

Stay tuned friends!
